# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is ImpactX?

ImpactX is a revolutionary platform for transparent and verifiable humanitarian aid distribution. It leverages blockchain technology, multi-source verification, and artificial intelligence to ensure that funds reach those who need them most while providing unprecedented transparency to donors.

### How does ImpactX ensure transparency?

ImpactX ensures transparency through several mechanisms:

1. **Blockchain Technology**: All transactions are recorded on the Algorand blockchain, providing an immutable and publicly verifiable ledger of fund movements.

2. **Multi-Source Verification**: We use a combination of NGO reports, IoT sensors, drone imagery, satellite data, and on-ground agents to verify that aid is being used as intended.

3. **Real-Time Dashboards**: Donors can track their contributions in real-time through comprehensive dashboards that show fund allocation, project progress, and impact metrics.

4. **Open Data**: We provide public access to anonymized data about aid distribution, allowing researchers and the public to analyze our effectiveness.
